# Book Search Engine


## Description

This project is a challenge to refactor a fully functioning Google Books API search engine from a RESTful API to a GraphQL API using Apollo Server. The original application is built with the MERN stack, featuring a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. The application allows users to search for books, save their searches, and perform user authentication.

The goal of this challenge is to leverage GraphQL's advantages in data querying and manipulation while improving the application's performance. Additionally, the existing authentication middleware needs to be modified to work seamlessly with the GraphQL API. Finally, the refactored application should be deployed to Heroku for easy access.
